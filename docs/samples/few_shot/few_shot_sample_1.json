            "Where can carbon be found?",
            "Carbon can be found in the atmosphere and on earth. On earth, carbon is mostly stored in rocks and sediments. The rest is located in the ocean, atmosphere, and in living organisms. The location of carbon is constantly in flux due to the carbon cycle. Carbon is released back into the atmosphere when organisms die, volcanoes erupt, fires blaze, fossil fuels are burned, and through a variety of other mechanisms."
